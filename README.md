# Hi, I'm Rachel!

I am a computer science student at Georgia Tech, and I am excited to share my programming blog: 

[**Rachel Decodes Tech**](https://rachel-d23.github.io/)

I write posts every week about what I am studying and learning, as well about careers in tech. The website is a project in itself, so I'm continually updating it! 

Here are some topics that I intend to cover (& I will update this list as I write about it!):
- my notes from [*Stanford Journalism: Computational Methods in the Civic Sphere*](http://www.compciv.org/curriculum/)
- Bash fundamentals 
- Data Structure & Algoritms in Java
- making an Android app to track how many miles I bike everyday
- imposter syndrome as a woman in tech 
- code anxiety? why I am just now discovering my passion for coding 
- my notes from the podcast Blossoming Technologist <!-- include personal connection with host -->
- what you need to know about your digital rights - my views on data privacy
