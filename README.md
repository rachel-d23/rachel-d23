## Hi, I'm Rachel!

I am a computer science student and aspiring software developer, and I am becoming more confident in my coding skills by writing for my blog: 
>Rachel Decodes Tech. 

I write posts about what I am studying and learning, as well careers in tech. 

In my free time, I like to 
- read books & fashion magazines
- bike (I built an app to track how many miles I bike!)
- watch birds 
- bake
- spend time with my family and friends
- watch TV and movies
